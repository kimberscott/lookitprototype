  <h2> Closing your eyes </h2> 
  <p> Occasionally we'll ask you to close your eyes for about 20 seconds while your child finds a particular action on the screen.  This is so your own 
  judgments can't accidentally influence where your child looks.  When you can open your eyes again, we'll play this chime: </p>
    <audio controls class='center' id='testaudio'>
	<source src='../../../sounds/beep.mp3' type='audio/mpeg'>
	<source src='../../../sounds/beep.ogg' type='audio/ogg'>

  <h2> Remove distractions </h2> 
  <p> During the experiment, it's important that nothing else 'pops up' and distracts your child.  Please exit any programs that might make distracting noises or windows (for example, an instant messaging program).</p> 
  
  <h2> Need to run? </h2> 
  <p> To end the experiment early at any point, just press 'F1' or close your browser window.  You'll be prompted to enter any notes about problems you're experiencing and choose a privacy level for any video recorded. 
  
 <h2> All set! </h2> 
  <p>Click 'Next' to start the videos.</p>
