  <h1> Getting set up </h1>

  <h2> Remove distractions </h2> 
  <p> During the experiment, it's important that nothing else 'pops up' and distracts your child.  Please exit any programs that might make distracting noises or windows (for example, an IM client).</p> 
  <h2> Need to run? </h2> 
  <p> To end the experiment early at any point, you can press the 'F1' or 'End' button on your keyboard.  At the end of the experiment (or if you end it early), you will decide whether to send your videos.  If you close this browser window before completing the experiment, we will see only your consent video. 
 <h2> All set! </h2> 
  <p>Click 'Next' to start the videos.</p>
