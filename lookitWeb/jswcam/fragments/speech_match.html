		   <li> <b> Duration: </b> Five minutes </li> 
		   <li> <b> What happens: </b> Your child will see eight short movies (about twenty seconds each), alternating between 'Calibration' movies which show a colorful ball spinning and 'Story' videos which show a woman's face reading two different Dr. Seuss snippets. You'll see sample frames before we start.</li> 
		   <li> <b> What we're studying: </b> Where your child prefers to look during the movies--at the faces that match the sound or the faces that don't?</li> </ul>
