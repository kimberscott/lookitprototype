<h2>Bringing science home</h2>
</div>
	
    <p>Here at MIT's Early Childhood Cognition Lab, we're trying a new approach in developmental psychology: bringing the experiments to you.</p>
	
<div class="title">
    <h2>Help us understand how your child sees the world</h2>
	</div>	
	<p>Our online studies are short and fun, and let you as a parent contribute to our collective understanding of the fascinating phenomenon of children's learning. In some experiments you'll step into the role of a researcher, asking your child questions or controlling the progression of the experiment based on his or her behavior.</p>

    <h2>Participate whenever and wherever</h2>
