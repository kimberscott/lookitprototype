  <ul class='overview-list'>
       <li> <b> Duration: </b> Ten minutes </li> 
       <li> <b> What happens: </b> First your child will see two actors naming familiar objects.  Sometimes they're correct, and sometimes they're not.  Then we'll show the same actors naming unfamiliar objects, and ask your child some questions about which answers he or she trusts.</li> 
	   <li> <b> What we're studying: </b> How children track and use information about reliability. </li> </ul>

  <p> The 'Familiar object' videos look like this.  Two actors will be introduced and asked to name various familiar objects, like a brush or rubber duck.  Usually, one is more accurate than the other.</p>

	<h2> Novel object videos </h2>
	<img class='center' src='ex/ex06/img/novelsample.jpg' width=300px/>
  <p> The 'Novel object' videos look like this.  The same two actors will name new, funny-looking objects with nonsense words. </p>
	</div>
	
		<div>
	Your child will be asked what he or she thinks each object is called.  Once your child responds, please repeat his or her answer,
	but try not to either confirm or correct the answer.  For instance, if your child said that the funny-looking object was a blicket, you'd just
	say "Okay, a blicket!" (Sometimes we have trouble hearing or understanding what kids are saying, and parents are their 
	best intepreters.)
