       <li> <b> Duration: </b> 5-10 minutes </li> 
       <li> <b> What happens: </b> We'll show your child some "lottery machines" with blue and yellow shapes bouncing around</li> 
	   <li> <b> What we're studying: </b> Whether infants detect and look longer at improbable outcomes (e.g. a yellow ball coming out of a mostly-blue machine) </li> </ul>

	<p>   Each of eight trials starts with this colorful shape moving on the screen to get your child's attention.

	 <h2> 2.  Set, </h2>
	<img src='ex/ex09/img/sample2.png' class='center'/>
	<p>  You and your child will watch together as some shapes bounce around in the machine for a few moments.  Then the video will pause and you'll hear some instructions.

	 <h2> 3.  Look! </h2>
	
	<img src='ex/ex09/img/sample3.png' class='center'/>
	For the first few trials, you and your child will watch together as a shape leaves the machine.  After that, we'll ask you to close your eyes for the "outcome" of each lottery so that you can't accidentally influence your child to look longer at some results than others.
