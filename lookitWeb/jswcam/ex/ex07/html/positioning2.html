  <h2> Speakers</h2>
  
  <p> We'll be playing a recorded story for your child, and it's important that your child is able to hear the sound.  Please try playing the music below to check that your speaker volume is set to a comfortable level.  </p>

  <h2> Need to run? </h2> 
  <p> To end the experiment early at any point, you can press the 'F1' or 'End' button on your keyboard.  At the end of the experiment (or if you end it early), you will decide whether to send your video.  If you close this browser window before completing the experiment, we will see only your consent video. 
  <h2> A reminder </h2> 
  <p>During the stories, please try not to draw attention to potential causes of the characters' problems--just let your child listen.  For instance, you might say 'Poor bunny, his tummy hurts!' but not 'Do you think Bunny ate something he shouldn't have?' 
  <p>Ready?  Click 'Next' to start the first story. </p>
