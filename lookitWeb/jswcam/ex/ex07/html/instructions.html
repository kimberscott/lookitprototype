  <ul class='overview-list'>
       <li> <b> Duration: </b> 5-10 minutes </li> 
       <li> <b> What happens: </b> We'll read some simple storybooks out loud. Then we'll ask your child why he or she thinks some of the events in the story occurred.</li> 
	   <li> <b> What we're studying: </b> How children reason about cause and effect. </li> </ul>

	<h2> Two storybooks </h2>

  <p> There are two stories, one very short and one longer, with questions at the end.  <p><b>During the stories, please try not to talk about potential causes of the characters' problems.</b>  For instance, you might say 'Poor bunny, his tummy hurts!' but not 'Do you think Bunny ate something he shouldn't have?'  This is so your own intuitions about cause and effect don't influence your child.</p>
