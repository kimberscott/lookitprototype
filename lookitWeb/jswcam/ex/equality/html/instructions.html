  <ul class='overview-list'>
       <li> <b> Duration: </b> 2 minutes </li> 
       <li> <b> What happens: </b> Your child will hear short audio clips (beeps or tones) while viewing related images</li> 
	   <li> <b> What we're studying: </b> Whether children connect the ideas of "same" and "different" across modalities (for instance, from "beeps all the same length" to "squares all the same size")</li> </ul>

  <p> Before each 15-second trial, you'll have a chance to draw your child's attention to the monitor with a colorful spinning ball like this.

	 <h2> and go! </h2>
	<img height=150px width=264px src='ex/equality/img/sample.png' class='center'/>
    <p> Then an image like the one above will show up, and <b>after a few seconds </b> an audio clip will start.  <b> During these sections please do not talk to your child or point to the screen! </b></p>
