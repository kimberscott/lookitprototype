  <ul class='overview-list'>
       <li> <b> Duration: </b> 2 minutes </li> 
       <li> <b> What happens: </b> Your child will hear short audio clips (beeps or tones) while viewing related images</li> 
	   <li> <b> What we're studying: </b> Whether children connect the ideas of "same" and "different" across modalities (for instance, from "beeps all the same length" to "squares all the same size")</li> </ul>

    <p> Then the audio clip will start, and after a few seconds an image like the one above will be shown.  <b> During these sections please do not talk to your child or point to the screen! </b></p>
