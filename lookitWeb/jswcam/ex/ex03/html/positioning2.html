  <h2> Your speakers</h2>
  
  <p> The movies we'll show in a moment include some sound, and it's important that your child is able to hear it.  Please try playing the music below to check that your speaker volume is set to a comfortable level.  </p>

  <h2> Remove distractions </h2> 
  <p> The movies we show will be full-screen (you may need to click 'allow' when prompted) and it's important that nothing else 'pops up' and distracts your child.  Please exit any programs that might make distracting noises or windows (e.g. an IM client).</p> 
  <h2> All set!</h2>
