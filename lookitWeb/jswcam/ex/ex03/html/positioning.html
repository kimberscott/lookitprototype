  <h1> Getting set up </h1>
  
  <h2> Your webcam </h2>
  
  <p>We're interested in where your child is looking during the videos, so we'd like to be able to see his or her face clearly on the webcam video that's recorded.</p>
  
  <div id='webcamdiv'></div>
  
  <p>Sit your child on your lap, and adjust your webcam if needed so that the view from your webcam (above) looks like the center picture below.  You may need to adjust the lighting or move your computer to a different location--take your time!  Try to get your child's face in the center of the picture, with both your faces visible.</p>
  
  <p>During the movies, please try to keep your child in approximately this same position, in view of the webcam.  (But don't worry: we know kids squirm!)</p>
