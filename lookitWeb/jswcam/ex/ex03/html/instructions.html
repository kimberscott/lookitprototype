  <p> A colorful shape moves on the left and then on the right of the screen.  We include these so that we know what it looks like when your child is looking to the left or to the right.  This lets us estimate where your child is looking during the 'Story' movies. </p>

    <p> The four 'Story' videos look like this.  The faces on the left and right are each reading part of a different Dr. Seuss story.  Only the sound from one of the videos is played.  </p>
