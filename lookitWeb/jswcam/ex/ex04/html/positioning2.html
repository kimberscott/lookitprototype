  <h2> Closing your eyes </h2> 
  <p> Occasionally we'll ask you to close your eyes for about 20 seconds while your child finds a particular action on the screen.  This is so your own 
  judgments can't accidentally influence where your child looks.  When you can open your eyes again, we'll play this chime: </p>

  <h2> Remove distractions </h2> 
  <p> During the experiment, it's important that nothing else 'pops up' and distracts your child.  Please exit any programs that might make distracting noises or windows (for example, an instant messaging program).</p> 
  
  <h2> Need to run? </h2> 
  <p> To end the experiment early at any point, you can press the 'F1' or 'End' button on your keyboard.  At the end of the experiment (or if you end it early), you will decide whether to send your videos.  If you close this browser window before completing the experiment, we will see only your consent video. 
  
 <h2> All set! </h2> 
  <p>Click 'Next' to start the videos.</p>
